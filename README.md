# **Tic-Tac-Toe in Python**

Using the framework from an assignment from [Jose Portilla's Python Bootcamp course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/), I created a simple tic-tac-toe game in Python.  I decided to take it a step further and make it an exercise for myself in writing proper functions (with docstrings), loops, and defensive code.

## **Playing the Game**

Simply open the tic_tac_toe.ipynb notebook, run all cells to define the game functions, then play the game in the last cell.

1. Player 1 chooses their marker
2. A random number generator is used to determine which player goes first
3. Players take turns by indicating which position on the game board they want to place their marker on
	- The position indices are mapped to the keyboard numpad layout (bottom left space is 1, upper right space is 9, etc.)

## **Next Steps**

Future work would involve finding a way to deploy this game to a simple website.
